# Codeacademy Web Development Path

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="./certificate/readme-certificate.jpg" "></div>

This repository contains projects that I built as I was following along the web development carreer-path by <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">codeacademy.com</a>

Code to start with was usually provided already so that student's could focus on applying new concepts.

Some projects were guided step-by-step, others provided only a solution to compare one's results with.
