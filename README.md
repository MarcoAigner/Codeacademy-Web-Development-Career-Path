# Codeacademy Web Development Path

<br></br>

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="./certificate/readme-certificate.jpg"></div>

<br></br>

This repository contains projects that I built as I was following along the web development career-path by <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">codeacademy.com</a>

Most projects provided a preexisting codebase so that students could focus on applying new concepts.

Some projects were guided step-by-step, others challenged to work on an own solution.
