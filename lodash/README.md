# The lodash library
## A partial and personal implementation

<a href="https://lodash.com/" target="_blank">Lodash</a> is a javascript utility-library that provides functions for common programming tasks.

As part of <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codeacademy's</a> Web-Development carreer path, I re-wrote some of the lodash functions.

Each method within <em>_.js</em> can be run against test-cases provided by Codeacademy by executing `node test/[method-name].js` in the terminal.
